# Microsoft FP&A Dashboard — Data Visualization & Analytics Engineering Project

This project demonstrates my ability to design clear, executive-level data visualizations that translate complex financial data into actionable insights — a core skill for data visualization and analytics engineering roles at Netflix.

The dashboard is inspired by real-world FP&A and corporate finance reporting workflows and focuses on clarity, storytelling, and decision-making efficiency.

## Data Visualization Principles Applied

- **KPI-first layout** for immediate insight
- **Minimalist design** to reduce cognitive load
- **Consistent formatting** for financial comparability
- **Clear hierarchy** between summary metrics and trends
- **Story-driven structure** rather than raw charts

These principles align closely with Netflix’s emphasis on clear, honest, and impactful data communication.
